  <p>ZEMAX RAY-TRACING EXECRISE NOTES FROM OPTICAL CONSTRUCTION COURSE<a id="more"></a></p>
<h1 id="RT0"><a href="#RT0" class="headerlink" title="RT0"></a>RT0</h1><h3 id="Standard-Spot-Diagram"><a href="#Standard-Spot-Diagram" class="headerlink" title="Standard Spot Diagram"></a>Standard Spot Diagram</h3><p>Clicking in the ”Standard Spot Diagram” icon under the “Rays &amp; Spot” icon in the Image Quality group under the “Analyze” tab.</p>
<p>You will in this spot diagram see the position of a number of rays originating from the object at the position of the image plane. Information about the size of the spot is given, both in terms of an RMS radius and a GEO radius in the lower part of the plot. The GEO radius is the radius of a circle in the image plane in which all rays fall. The RMS radius is the root-mean-square value of the radius of the positions the rays intercept in the image plane. The latter one is the most relevant. However, it can be worth to note that since a ray tracing program only calculates the fate of certain rays, the values of these two indicators (the RMS and the GEO radii) depend on how many rays the program considers and in which “pattern” they are sent out. There is a standard set of ray patterns and number of rays that the program uses, but one can also chose other sets. You can toggle between three such patterns in the Setting window, which you open by clicking on the small downwards arrow in the upper left corner of the window of the Spot Diagram. Alter between, “Squared”, “Hexapolar”, and “Dithered”, and see the effect of this. You can also increase the number of rays. For a simple system like this, the extra time it takes to calculate more rays than the predetermined value of 6 is negligible. Therefore, use to some larger value, e.g. 24, and see the effect. Use “Dithered” and a ray density of 24. What is the RMS size of this spot (you should get an RMS spot size between 200 and 400 µm, if not, redo)</p>
<h3 id="“Solve”-routine"><a href="#“Solve”-routine" class="headerlink" title="“Solve” routine"></a>“Solve” routine</h3><p>There is also another way of finding the paraxial position of the image (instead of using the optimization routine), namely to use a “Solve” routine. To use the “Solve” routine, double-click on the small square box of the cell you just optimized (the thickness cell of row 2) and, instead of using “Variable”, chose “Marginal Ray Height”. This solve-routine will help the program to find the value of the lens-to-image distance that forces the marginal ray (the marginal ray is the ray that originates from the optical axis and passes the aperture stop/entrance pupil at a given height/pupil zone, in general at the rim of the aperture stop/entrance pupil) to arrive at a height given by the “Height” value in the image plane. We want to find the paraxial focus. Hence, the ray height should be specified to 0 (which is the default value).</p>
<p>Next to specify is which ray should be considered. You specify this by specifying a “Pupil Zone” value. We know now that the paraxial focus is the position for which rays with a virtually zero angle focus to one spot (all higher order terms become negligible). The “Pupil Zone” value refers to the (normalized) height of the beam in the entrance aperture (the STOP surface) of the system. We get rays with 0 angles, and hence the position of the paraxial focus, by specifying the Pupil Zone” value to 0. Therefore, run “Marginal Ray Height” with zeros for both the “Height” and the “Pupil Zone” values. </p>
<h3 id="RAY-RACING-USING-ARAXIAL-SURFACES"><a href="#RAY-RACING-USING-ARAXIAL-SURFACES" class="headerlink" title="RAY- RACING USING  ARAXIAL SURFACES"></a>RAY- RACING USING  ARAXIAL SURFACES</h3><p>The ZEMAX program has also a possibility to use non-spherical surfaces (as for example, adding a small conical behavior to the spherical shape that will compensate for many types of aberrations).<br>But, it has also the sometimes useful feature of introducing completely aberration-free surfaces (i.e. a surface that exactly follows theparaxial theory). These are called paraxial surfaces.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="RT1"><a href="#RT1" class="headerlink" title="RT1"></a>RT1</h1><p>Create  a  Lens  Data  editor  that  describes  the  situation.  Start  by  making  a  lens  made out of<br>two lens surfaces, each of them of paraxial type (and each having half the  refractive  power,  i.e.,  twice  the  actual  focal  length,  i.e.  40  mm),  but,  with  no  distance  in  between.  This  is<br>convenient  when  comparisons  with  finite  thickness  lenses are going to be done later on. Select an “Entrance Aperture Diameter” of 10 mm under the  “Aperture“  tab  of  the  SYSTEM<br>EXPLORER.  Place  the  image  plane at  a  so  far  arbitrary  position  behind  the  lens,  e.g.  at  100  mm.  For  display  purposes, you can make the lens larger than the minimum size. Give the lens, for simplicity, a semi-diameter of 8 mm.</p>
<p>run  the  optimization  procedure  (do  not  forget  to  start  with  the  “Optimization Wizard”  icon  in  the  Automatic  Optimization  group  under  the  “Optimize”  tab, and use Type: “RMS”,  Criteria “Spot Radius”, and Reference “Chief Ray” as be-fore, and use 4 rings, before you run “Optimize!” in the Automatic Optimization group under the “Optimize” tab) and find out where the image plane is localized. Look also at the Layout.</p>
<h3 id="Determine-the-transverse-magnification"><a href="#Determine-the-transverse-magnification" class="headerlink" title="Determine the transverse magnification"></a>Determine the transverse magnification</h3><p>In order to determine the transverse magnification of the system, you need to place another object at a certain distance from the optical axis. Open the “Fields”   tab in the SYSTEM EXPLORER.  The  type  of  field  chosen  under “Settings”should be “Object Height”. If not set, change to this. By default, you have one field point set (termed Field 1). If you open this tab, you will see that this field point is at x = 0, and y = 0, and that it has a weight of 1.  Now you need to create another field point. Open the “Add Field” tab and set this at x = 0, and y = 10, with a weight of 1. Note that you have to click on the Enable box, be able to set this field point.</p>
<p>Remember this for the future. Every time you alter the number of field points (or the  number  of  wavelengths,  see  coming  exercises)  you  need  to  open  and  run the Merit Function Editor again.</p>
<p>the actual position of the rays from the uppermost part of the object can, for ex-ample, be found by invoking the ”Standard Spot Diagram” icon under the “Rays &amp; Spot” icon in the Image Quality group under the “Analyze” tab. You should be able  to  read  the  center  position  of  the  beams  both  at  the  object  and  the  image  plane.  The  ratio  should  give  you  the  transverse magnification. Which transverse magnification does this system have?</p>
<h3 id="Fixed-L-SIM-SOB"><a href="#Fixed-L-SIM-SOB" class="headerlink" title="Fixed L = SIM + SOB"></a>Fixed L = SIM + SOB</h3><p>In  this  case  you  need  to  optimize  an  intermediate  position  (i.e.  that  of  the  lens)  while  holding  the  object-to-image  distance  fixed.  You  can  accomplish  this  by  double  clicking  on  the  Thicknesscell  of  the  last  lens  surface  and  choose  “Position” instead of “Fixed” or “Variable” that we have used before. You can here determine the position from another given surface. Choose “From Surface:” “0” and “Length:” “160”. This implies that the image plane always will be positioned 160 mm behind the object plane. Hence, you can now optimize the position of the lens as  you  want.  Change  the  Thickness  cell  of  the  uppermost  row  to  “Variable”  so that  you  can  optimize  the  position  of  the  lens.  A  possible  starting  point  (if  you  model your lens as two surfaces) could then look like as foll.</p>
<h3 id="Add-the-magnification-constraint"><a href="#Add-the-magnification-constraint" class="headerlink" title="Add the magnification constraint"></a>Add the magnification constraint</h3><p>One  way  of  doing  this  is  to  open  the merit function(in Wizards and operand)and then add one more opti-mization condition (the magnification constraint). This you can do by adding one more line in the merit function. This line should be the first line. Click in any of the cells in the DFMS line. Press “Insert”. They you get a dummy line, with the command BLNK (for Blank) as the type. You need to exchange this to some more useful command. Click in the small squared box of this cell. You should then get a list of possible optimization operands. These you can use at any time in your ray tracing  (you  can  read  about  this  in  the  help  files).  In  this  case,  use  PMAG, since this puts a requirement on the paraxial magnification. This magnification we want to lock to -0.5. Therefore, type PMAG for the “type” of this operand (in place of BLNK). You need to give the target value of this, which thus is  -0.5. Type this in the target column. Then you need to give it a weight. Give it a weight of 1 (which is  a  standard  value).  Now  when  you  run  the  optimization,  the  program  will  both try to minimize the spot size in the image plane (or the aberrations) but also try to accomplish  a  system  with  a  paraxial  magnification  of  -0.5.  Run  the  optimization  and determine the focal length and the lens position.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="RT2"><a href="#RT2" class="headerlink" title="RT2"></a>RT2</h1><p>Remember that in order to get the focal length of such a system (which is a parax-ial  quantity),  you  have  to  look  at  rays  that  go  close  to  the  optical  axis.  This  you  can do either by using the optimization routine for the focal length (with the radii of  curvature  of  the  first  surface  as  a  variable,  with  the  second  surface  having  the  same radius of curvature but with opposite sign, which can be done by the “Pick up”  routine, with  a  fixed  value  for  the  distance  between  the  last  surface  and  the  image plane, and with a very small entrance pupil diameter) or by using the Solve routine  for  the  marginal  ray  height  (“Marginal  Ray  Height”, 0,0) and  manually  trying various radii</p>
<h3 id="Creating-a-parallel-pencil-of-rays"><a href="#Creating-a-parallel-pencil-of-rays" class="headerlink" title="Creating a parallel pencil of rays"></a>Creating a parallel pencil of rays</h3><p>let the object have an in-finite  distance  to  the  first  surface,  which  also  is  the  “Aperture Stop” (also called the “Surface  Stop”  in ZEMAX).  If  you  want  to  see  some  parts  of  the  parallel  rays  falling in on your lens system (in the Layout window) you can add an extra non-refractive  dummy  surface  in  front  of  the  lens.  This  non-refractive  surface,  which  can serve as the entrance pupil, should not refract the rays. Hence, it should be fol-lowed by only air (no glass material). It should, however, have a certain distance to the lens. This distance can be quite arbitrary (since parallel light rays are emerg-ing from the surface) so as to create a nice layout.</p>
<p>Insert therefore a new surface directly after the object surface. (Click in any cell of surface 1 and press the “Insert” key on the keyboard.) Type a suitable number for its  thickness  in  the“Thickness”column.  Any  number  in  the  range  10  to  50  will  suffice. Make sure that the distance from the object to the first “dummy” surface is infinite. Let this time the dummy surface be the ”Aperture Stop”. You do this by double  clicking  in  the  first  cell  of  the  row,  which  reads  “1”,  (or  by  marking any cell of row 1 and then opening the “Settings” window, which you do by pressing the arrow that points down enclosed in a circle (i.e. ) and click in the box for the “Make  Surface  Stop”.  You  will  find  that  the  surface  stop  has  changed  from  the  first surface of the lens to this new fictitious surface. When you look in the Layout window, make sure you plot the optical system from surface 1 to surface 4 (see the “Settings” window).   We will come back to the importance of the” Aperture Stop”in later Ray Tracing exercises. </p>
<p align="center"><br>  <img src="/images/Aperture Stop.jpg" alt="2" width="100%" height="100%"><br></p><br>One why to find this  is  to  use  the  optimization    routine  you  used  in  a  previous  Ray  Tracing  exer-cise,  another  is “Marginal  Ray  Height”  solve  (for  the  latter,  double-click  on  the  small  square  box  of  the thickness  cell  of  the  last  surface of  the  lens  and  choose “Marginal Ray Height”)<br><p align="center"><br>  <img src="/images/marginal ray height.jpg" alt="2" width="100%" height="100%"><br></p>

<h3 id="Set-Surface-Stop"><a href="#Set-Surface-Stop" class="headerlink" title="Set Surface Stop"></a>Set Surface Stop</h3><p>Make sure that the lens is the “Surface Stop”. (If not, double-click in the first cell of the first surface of the lens, i.e. the cell that reads “Paraxial”,and then click in the “Make Surface Stop” box.</p>
<h3 id="Optimize-the-system"><a href="#Optimize-the-system" class="headerlink" title="Optimize the system"></a>Optimize the system</h3><p>When you optimize the system, do not forget to start with the “Optimization Wiz-ard”  icon  in  the  Automatic  Optimization  group  under  the  “Optimize”  tab,  and  use Type: “RMS”,  Criteria “Spot Radius”, and Reference “Chief Ray” as before, and use 4 rings, before you run “Optimize!” in the Automatic Optimization group under the “Optimize” tab</p>
<h3 id="Report"><a href="#Report" class="headerlink" title="Report"></a>Report</h3><p>You can find information about the positions of the principal planes of an optical  system  in  “Prescription  data”, which  you  find  under  the  under  the  “Re-port” icon in the Reports group under the “Analyze” tab. and thereby check that the equation you derived above is correct.</p>
<h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>Open the “Cooke 40 degree field” lens (one of the example files that are supplied with  the program,  can  be  found  under  Zemax\sample\sequential\objectives)1  and look  at  the  layout  window.  This  system  shows  the  basic  design  of  a  real  Cooke .triplet. One positive lens, one negative lens (made of another glass material so as to minimize chromatic aberrations, something you will look closer to in a comingray tracing exercise) followed by one positive lens finally. You can see how light from  three  different  angels  (from  far  away,  e.g.  infinity)  propagate  through  the  system. Please hold this system in your mind when you are working with the sim-plified paraxial lenses in the exercise below (so you do not lose grip of the reality).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="RT4"><a href="#RT4" class="headerlink" title="RT4"></a>RT4</h1><h3 id="Specify-that-the-wavelength-of-the-light"><a href="#Specify-that-the-wavelength-of-the-light" class="headerlink" title="Specify  that  the  wavelength  of  the  light"></a>Specify  that  the  wavelength  of  the  light</h3><p>Specify  that  the  wavelength  of  the  light  is  587.562 nm.  This  you  do  by  opening  the “Wavelength”tab in the SYSTEM EXPLORERand then, under “Settings” and“Preset”, select “d(0.587)”. When you have selected this as your primary wave-length,  press  the  button  “Select  Preset”  to  execute  this  choice.  You  can  see  that  you  have  selected  this  wavelength  as  your  primary  wavelength  if  the  text  in  the  next tab “Wavelength 1 (0,xxx μm, Weight = 1,000)” displays this wavelength, i.e. if it reads “Wavelength 1 (0,588 μm, Weight = 1,000)”.</p>
<h3 id="Material-catalogue"><a href="#Material-catalogue" class="headerlink" title="Material catalogue"></a>Material catalogue</h3><p>The reason for this particular wavelength to be of special importance is that it cor-responds to a yellow line in the spectrum from helium (at 587.5618 nm). The in-dex  of  refraction  at  this  wavelength  is  commonly  abbreviated dn. Find out what the actual index of refraction of BK7 is at this wavelength, i.e. determine the dn - value. (There is an extensive catalogue with many types of glasses, termed “mate-rial catalogue”, incorporated into the program that can give you a lot of useful in-formation. Remember that BK7 is a Schott glass.) </p>
<h3 id="Find-a-particular-glass"><a href="#Find-a-particular-glass" class="headerlink" title="Find  a particular  glass"></a>Find  a particular  glass</h3><p>he easiest way to find a particular  glass in this catalogue is to type BK7 in the Material column in the Lens Data editor and then mark the name of the glass be-fore you open the material catalogue. It then opens directly with information about this particular type of glass at this particular wavelength, i.e. with info about n_d. alternatively,  if  you  type  BK7  in  the  Material  column in  theLens  Data  editor, you can also find its index of refraction for the wavelength used (thus not only at 587.5618  nm)  in “Prescription  data”,  which  you  find  under  the  under  the  “Re-ports” icon in the Reports group under the “Analyze” tab. Look about half down the document. Check that you can find the value of the index of refraction at both places. </p>
<h3 id="The-RMS-spot-size-of-the-focus"><a href="#The-RMS-spot-size-of-the-focus" class="headerlink" title="The (RMS) spot size of the focus"></a>The (RMS) spot size of the focus</h3><p>The (RMS) spot size of this focus (look in the ”Standard Spot Diagram”icon  under  the  “Rays  &amp;  Spot”  icon  in  the  Image  Quality  group  under  the  “Ana-lyze” tab and use “Dithered” as “Pattern” under “Settings” and a ray density of 24)?</p>
<h3 id="Selecting-“F-d-C-visible-”"><a href="#Selecting-“F-d-C-visible-”" class="headerlink" title="Selecting “F, d, C (visible)”"></a>Selecting “F, d, C (visible)”</h3><p>Expand now the number of wavelengths you are using to 3. In the “Wavelength” tab in the SYSTEM EXPLORER you should use 486.1 nm as wavelength number 1, 587.6 nm as wavelength number 2 and 656.3 nm as wavelength number 3 (the yel-low helium line and the blue and red hydrogen Fraunhofer lines). Make the 0.5876 μm  wavelength  the  “primary”  one.  Note  that  you  can  get  all  these  three  wave-lengths  directly  by  selecting “F,  d,  C  (visible)”  under “Settings” and  “Preset”. When you have pressed“Select Preset” you should get three lines(tabs) of wave-lengths below the “Settings” tab reading“Wavelength 1 (0,486 μm, Weight = 1,000)”,<br>“Wavelength 2 (0,588 μm, Weight = 1,000)”,<br>“Wavelength 3 (0,656 μm, Weight = 1,000)”</p>
<h3 id="Select-all-wavelength"><a href="#Select-all-wavelength" class="headerlink" title="Select all wavelength"></a>Select all wavelength</h3><p>there is a “Wavelength” box in the upper right most corner in which you can specify which wavelengths you want to study. Choose “All”. You need also to choose “Wave #” in the “Color Rays By:”box.  Do  the  same  with  the  “Spot  Diagram”  window  (and  use  again  “Dithered”and  a  “Ray  Density”  of  24). You are now ready to see what happens with all the light beams in the system. </p>
<h3 id="Update-all-widows"><a href="#Update-all-widows" class="headerlink" title="Update all widows"></a>Update all widows</h3><p>(double click in them or use the fast red button with two curly arrows in theQUICK ACCESS TOOLBAR).</p>
<h3 id="Dealing-with-chromatic-aberration"><a href="#Dealing-with-chromatic-aberration" class="headerlink" title="Dealing  with  chromatic aberration."></a>Dealing  with  chromatic aberration.</h3><p>There  are  two  different  windows  that  are  of  particular  use  when  dealing  with  chromatic aberration.  The  first  one  is  called  “Focal  Shift”  and  can  be  opened  by  invoking  the  ”Chro-matic Focal Shift” icon under the “Aberrations” icon in the Image Quality group under  the  “Analyze”  tab.  This  window  shows  you  the  shift  in  focal  length  as  a  function of wavelength.<br>The  other  useful  window  is  the  “Through  Focus  Spot  Diagram”  and  can  be  opened by invoking the” Through Focus Spot Diagram” icon under the “Rays  &amp;  Spot”  icon  in  the  Image  Quality  group  under  the  “Analyze” tab. This  window  shows  you  five  different  spot  diagrams.  Adjusting  some  parameters  under  “Set-tings” (the arrow that points down enclosed in a circle,  i.e. the ) will give you a nice result. Choose a ”Ray Density” around 5 - 10 (depending on your monitor), ”Delta  Focus”  to  500  (μm),  do  not  select  “Use  Symbols”,  use  “Pattern:”  “Dith-ered”, and make sure that “Wavelength” is set to ”All”. Depending on your moni-tor, you can play around with the line thickness, it is often easiest to see this if you select the “thin” or “thinnest” line thickness (change “standard” to “thin” or “thin-nest”).<br>What you will see is how the spot diagrams look like in focus, as well as 500 and 1000 μm in front of and behind the focus. As you see in this case, the focus of the green wavelength (i.e. the one at 587 nm, the middle one in wavelength) is close to the selected image plane (i.e. in focus), the blue wavelength (486 nm) has a fo-cus  about  1  mm  in  front  of  this  focus  while  the  red  one  (656  nm)  has  its  focus  about half a millimeter behind the selected focus. This is a pictorial illustration of what the “Through Focus Spot Diagram” shows.</p>
<h3 id="Effective-focal-length-by-using-marginal-ray-angle"><a href="#Effective-focal-length-by-using-marginal-ray-angle" class="headerlink" title="Effective focal length by using marginal ray angle"></a>Effective focal length by using marginal ray angle</h3><p>Select  now  somewhat  more  suitable  thicknesses  of  the  lenses:  3  mm  for  the  first  one and 2 mm for the second one. The actual focal length will then change. Reop-timize the optical system so that you get a focal length of exactly 100 mm by let-ting  both  the  first  radius  and  the  distance  between  the  last  lens  and  the  image  plane be variable, make the first lens symmetrical, i.e. 11RR′= − (by a pick up of the  first  surface),  let  the  lenses  be  cemented,  i.e.  21RR′=,  and  use  a  “Marginal Ray Angle” solve of the radius of the last lens surface of -0.1. The “Marginal Ray Angle”  solve  is  a  useful  way  of  getting  a  certain  effective  focal  length.  A “Mar-ginal  Ray  Angle”  solve of  the  radius  of  the  last  lens  surface  of  -0.1  should  give  you  an  effective  focal  length  of  100  mm.  Spend  some  time  thinking  about  whythis is the case. What does a marginal ray angle of -0.1 imply?</p>
<h1 id="RT5"><a href="#RT5" class="headerlink" title="RT5"></a>RT5</h1><h3 id="Standard-Spot-Diagram-1"><a href="#Standard-Spot-Diagram-1" class="headerlink" title="Standard Spot Diagram"></a>Standard Spot Diagram</h3><p>The GEO radius, given in the lower part of the plot, gives the radius within which all the rays are collected. Hence, the GEO radius gives information about the dis-tance  to  the  ray  that  is  farthest  from  the  central  reference  point.  This  radius  thus  corresponds  to  the  maximum ray  aberrations  Yε  and Xε  defined  in  the  course  material.The RMS radius, on the other hand, gives a root-mean-square value of the radius of  all  the  rays.  The  RMS  radius  is  often  a  more  useful  and  representative  entity  since it gives a weighted distribution of the rays.</p>
<h3 id="Through-Focus-Spot-Diagram”"><a href="#Through-Focus-Spot-Diagram”" class="headerlink" title="Through Focus Spot Diagram”"></a>Through Focus Spot Diagram”</h3><p>The “Through Focus Spot Diagram” shows you the spot diagram from a number of  rays  emerging  from  one  (or  a  selected  number  of)  single  point  in  the  object  plane not only in the image plane but also at a few planes in close proximity to the image plane. This menu is particularly useful in systems where some rays will fo-cus in  front  of  the  chosen  image  plane  while  others  focus  slightly  behind,  as  oc-curs for “Chromatic Aberrations” as well as a few of the monochromatic aberra-tions,  e.g.  “Spherical  Aberration”  and “Curvature  of  Field”.You  will  address  these in detail in future problem sets.  When you invoke this window for the single lens, you will find two rows with five spot  diagrams  in  each.  Each  spot  diagram  in  each  row  s  calculated  for  a  specific position with respect to the chosen image plane. The middle one is exactly at the position of the image plane. The other ones are the spot diagrams as they look in front or behind the image plane. The two rows correspond to the two fields. In the ”Settings” menu there is a box for specifying the shift in position between each of these diagrams (“Delta Focus”) in units of μm. Select 1000 μm and make sure  you  are  looking  at  the  single  lens.  Select  “Dithered”  and  a  suitable  “Ray Density”  also  in  the  “Options”  window  (12 is  fairly  OK).  You  can  switch  be-tween  to  ”Use  Symbols”  and  not  to  “Use  Symbols”,  and  to  use  “All”  or  one wavelength  at  a  time  in  the  “Wavelength”  box  to  see  what  you  think  is  best  for  your particular application. Start with the single lens. </p>
<h3 id="Enclosed-Energy"><a href="#Enclosed-Energy" class="headerlink" title="Enclosed Energy"></a>Enclosed Energy</h3><p>The program gives the user also the possibility to investigate the amount (or frac-tion)  of  rays  in  a  fan  that  hits  the  image  plane  within  a  certain  radius  from  the  spot.  This  is  referred  to  as  “Enclosed  (or  Encircled)  Energy”.  Under  the  Image Quality group under the “Analyze” tab you can find the “Enclosed Energy” icon. Under  this,  you  can  find  few  different  types  of  “Enclosed Energy” diagram  of which two are “Diffraction” and “Geometric.</p>
<h3 id="Optical-Path"><a href="#Optical-Path" class="headerlink" title="Optical Path"></a>Optical Path</h3><p>The program  can  also  display  cuts  through  the  “Wave  Map”,  so  called  “OPD Fans”  (“Wave  Aberration  Sections  “in  the  course  material)  or  “OPD”  diagrams, where “OPD” stands for “Optical Path Difference”. This can be opened by invok-ing  the  “Optical  Path”  command  under  the  “  “Aberrations”  icon  in  the  Image  Quality group under the “Analyze” tab. They will give you information about the optical path difference along the tangential and sagittal cuts at the exit pupil (the two orthogonal directions of the “Wavefront Map”).  If  more  than  one  wavelength  is  used,  one  curve  for  each  wavelength  will  be  dis-played. Look at the “OPD Fans” for the two lenses. Look not only at the shapes of  the  curves  for  the  two  optical  systems;  pay  also  attention  to  the  maximum  scales (which sometimes can be more important than the actual shapes). </p>
<h3 id="Ray-Fan"><a href="#Ray-Fan" class="headerlink" title="Ray Fan"></a>Ray Fan</h3><p>The program can also display cuts through the “Spot Diagram” display. The “Ray Fan” window can be opened by invoking the “Ray Aberration” command either under  the  “Rays  &amp;  Spot”  icon  or  the  “Aberrations”  icon in  the  Image  Quality  group  under  the  “Analyze”  tab. This window  shows  plots  of  the  ray  aberration  (defined  as  the  difference  between  the  actual  image  point  and  the  image  point  of  the chief ray in the image plane) as a function of the height of the exit pupil.The “Ray  Fan”  curves  are also the  derivatives  of  the  OPD  curves  discussed  above.  You  get  three  curves  in  each  diagram  (corresponding  to  the  three  wave-lengths), one diagram for each plane (tangential and sagittal) and one pair of dia-grams  for  each  field  (bundle  of  ray  direction).  Compare  the  “OPD”  curves  with  the “Ray Fans” and make sure you understand how they are related.  </p>
<h3 id="Field-Curvature-and-Distortion"><a href="#Field-Curvature-and-Distortion" class="headerlink" title="Field Curvature and Distortion"></a>Field Curvature and Distortion</h3><p>The “Field  Curvature” and  “Distortion” aberrations can  be  display  by  the com-bined “Field  Curvature  and  Distortion”  command.  This  command  can  be  found  under  the “Aberrations”  icon  in  the  Image  Quality  group  under  the  “Analyze”tab</p>
<h1 id="RT6"><a href="#RT6" class="headerlink" title="RT6"></a>RT6</h1><h3 id="OPD-Fans"><a href="#OPD-Fans" class="headerlink" title="OPD Fans"></a>OPD Fans</h3><p>The program  can  also  display  cuts  through  the  “Wave  Map”,  so  called  “OPD Fans”  (“Wave  Aberration  Sections  “in  the  course  material)  or  “OPD”  diagrams, where “OPD” stands for “Optical Path Difference”. This can be opened by invok-ing  the  “Optical  Path”  command  under  the  “  “Aberrations”  icon  in  the  Image  Quality group under the “Analyze” tab. They will give you information about the optical path difference along the tangential and sagittal cuts at the exit pupil (the two orthogonal directions of the “Wavefront Map”). </p>
<h1 id="RT8"><a href="#RT8" class="headerlink" title="RT8"></a>RT8</h1><h3 id="Effective-Focal-Length"><a href="#Effective-Focal-Length" class="headerlink" title="Effective  Focal  Length)"></a>Effective  Focal  Length)</h3><p>When  you  optimize,  always  use  the  default  sequential merit  function  with RMS spot radius referenced to the chief ray.  To make systems with the same effective focal  length,  add  the  operand  EFFL  (Effective  Focal  Length)  with  target  105  on  the  first  line  in  the  merit  function  editor  (make a new line before the DMFS line and type EFFL in its first box). Use a weight of 1 for the EFFL command. </p>
<h3 id="Prescription-data"><a href="#Prescription-data" class="headerlink" title="Prescription data"></a>Prescription data</h3><p>or every lens that you design, make data sheets that include the most relevant in-formation, which should at least consist of  •information about the lenses (radii, types of glass, distances, etc),  •a layout,  •OPDs,  •Ray fans,  •spot diagrams, and  •a short compilation of the Seidel coefficients.  One  way  of  documenting  the  information  about  the  lenses  (radii,  types  of  glass,  distances, etc., i.e. the lens data editor) is to open the “Prescription data”, which you find under the under the “Report” icon in the Reports group under the “Ana-lyze”  tab., since this contains the lens data editor. You can then save this in text format somewhere, and cut the lens data editor from this text file and past it into your text editor. You can do the same to retrieve the Seidel coefficients from the “Seidel coefficient” window, which can be found under the “Aberrations” icon in the Image Quality group under the “Analyze” tab. </p>
